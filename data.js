This is mainly because ice is a solid state element, and thus, the user cannot simply dissolve out of harm's way as most Logia users can with their fluid bodies, and it is slower in terms of reforming the body when damaged. However, most attacks are still ineffective against this fruit because its user can simply shatter and reform the ice composing them on impact.

Gasparde can turn into liquid syrup to let attacks bypass him, evading harm. However, he has not fully mastered his ability, thus a surprise attack can cause him pain.<br><br> Gasparde's primary method of attack is akin to how the Toge Toge no Mi is used: transforming parts of his body into spikes of hardened syrup to impale his opponents, or covering his entire body full of spikes and launching himself forward to heavily skewer them, which also was meant to serve as a deterrent from counterattacks. Gasparde also used the syrupy properties to mimic Luffy's rubber elasticity powers, stretching his arms forward to extend his syrup spear, and to create a slingshot effect for his own body.<br><br>Weakness:<br> Like a few other Logia Devil Fruits, this one has a weakness that can nullify its intangibility: flour.

For example, the user can similarly merge themselves with a mountainside or floors built from wood, as long as they are in contact with them. Depending on the size of the island, the user can become a fearsome opponent thanks to the sheer scale of their ability's range and the fact that the vast majority of the world's landmasses consist of islands. Even cannonfire from a Marine battleship is not sufficient to hurt or even delay the user when they are merged with a large enough island.<br><br>The user can further manipulate the landmarks they are assimilated with to perform actions such as emoting or talking (by creating a fissure on a surface to act as a mouth, for example). Even objects that are located outside the island's borders can still be reached out by the user (by shaping the island's geography into gigantic limbs). The user is also apparently sensitive to the actions of people that act upon the environment they are merged with, which can be applied for surveillance purposes (such as detecting a mass breakout of escaping prisoners through itching, for example).<br><br>Weakness:<br>The fruit's most noteworthy weakness comes from the fact that since the user is effectively fused with the island they are controlling, the island itself acts as a manifestation of their body, which means that any significant damage dealt to the island's environment will be reflected on the user's true body while they are merged together. Enemies with enough physical strength can exploit this by attacking any part of the island that is being manipulated by the user, who is otherwise an enormous target, in order to hurt or distract them."

These nets take on the properties of the materials the user ingested and can give the user a variety of attacks.

The user has seemingly no limit to how long they can use the materials to make the nets as well as manipulate the nets in any way they want.<br><br>The most powerful strength of the fruit is that the user can become a net himself, similar to a Logia user. When transformed into a net, the force of any physical blow dealt onto the user's body is displaced over the surface of the net. This is similar to how a soccer net is capable of catching a fast moving soccer ball without being torn into shreds. This grants a defense somewhat similar to that of the Gomu Gomu no Mi as the attacks bounce off. Furthermore, the user can capture an opponent within their own body. While the user can ingest different materials to produce different types of nets, they are however still susceptible to the condition of some materials.

The fruit also becomes less effective in dense locations such as a forest as it is very easy for the target to hide behind obstacles, thus it is more ideal for the user to be in wide open spaces like a beach or a meadow.

It also appears that the strength of this particular fruit is directly proportional to the amount of stone in the user's environment, and any damage done to the stone the user controls is not inflicted upon the user themselves, so long as their true body is not harmed. Because of this, at sufficient amounts, the user can withstand having pieces of their body destroyed to no end.<br><br>Weakness:<br> The user needs to be merged with the stone in order to control it. In fact, the user's body does not actually transform into stone, but instead resides within it, and that portion is as vulnerable as any normal person. Also, if the user assimilates with stone and then loses contact with the ground (such as being sent into midair), the main body is unable to assimilate any stone from nearby environment. In that case, if the airborne stone containing the body is reduced into smaller pieces, the user has no choice but to emerge with his own body."

The user can even break the mirrors the individuals are trapped in, completely preventing anyone from entering or exiting that mirror ever again.

The mirrors appear to have some form of sentience, as they can be asked questions, such as their locations or whether they have seen certain people.

This can be done in two ways. First, by hovering an open book above the target, they will be placed under the visual illusion that they are within the book's world, which will cease once the book is shut. Secondly, the user can physically trap targets inside a book, turning them into an illustration within that book, where they will not age; Mont d'Or is usually seen pinning down his captives with oversized nails, which are seemingly unbreakable. A person can travel in and out of a book at will by inserting a special bookmark into the page.<br><br>The user can also use books as a means of distant and broad communication. Mont d'Or was shown calling multiple Den Den Mushi at once by connecting them all to a book, while he and his own Den Den Mushi were on top of another book. The specific mechanics of this ability are unknown. Placing a target under the illusion of a book's setting only impairs their sight, allowing them to still move around and use other senses, as shown when Luffy was able to hear Nami and move around while under the illusion. Similarly, targets trapped inside a book can still communicate with the real world so long as the page they are on is kept open.<br><br>Weakness:<br>Moreover, prisoners can be released by burning the books they are kept in, although this can be hazardous to them as well."

No matter how famous the victim was or how close they were to others, the victim will be completely forgotten by everyone. Toys are still able to remember their own identities, but they will not remember anyone else who has been turned into a toy as well. The memory erasure effect is instantaneous, as even spectators who witness the transformation first hand instantly forget the victims' existence, instead believing the toys suddenly appeared out of nowhere. This makes them much easier to enslave as there would be no one to remember and thus attempt to rescue them.<br><br>Weakness:<br>Killing the user or knocking them unconscious, whether through pain or fear, will immediately cancel out all the transformation and memory modification effects. Despite the memory erasure being powerful, it does not affect physical evidence of those transformed such as an inscribed name or an engraved statue."

A shadow follows the soul of its owner's movements; This Devil Fruit allows the user to change that absolute rule. With this power, the user can grab hold of their victim's shadow and cut it off. After removing a shadow from a host, they can then place it into a lifeless corpse in order to create an obedient zombie minion. The minion that is created gains all the fighting techniques of the shadow's owner. The zombie will also adopt the shadow's personality quirks, though the zombie will eventually lose these quirks and become subservient to the Devil Fruit user. As for the original owner of the shadow, they will enter a two day long coma once their shadow is separated from them. The original owner of the shadow will be forced to remain in darkness, as they will vaporize if hit by sunlight without their shadow. It is worth noting that while being exposed to daylight after having one's shadows extracted usually means instant death, victims who had their shadows extracted for some time can actually last a little more under the sun; The Devil Fruit user also has full control over whether or not the shadows return to their original owners; simply defeating the user, or even killing them, will not return the shadows they have stolen.<br><br>The user is also able to manifest their own shadow as a semi liquid physical form. They are then able to control their shadow and make it fight for them in their stead. Their shadow, as a physical manifestation, is a being of strength similar to that of a Logia Devil Fruit user as their shadow, in that state, is impervious to damage.

Each one capable of speech on their own. It appears that the user has some degree of control over the number of heads that can sprout at once, with eight being the maximum limit. Additionally, Orochi's main head is a darker shade of green than the others.<br><br>Usage:<br>He was also strong enough to easily lift up a person with just one of his mouths. With their multiple heads with long necks, the user has the ability to attack in multiple directions at once and reach targets that are further away than he could normally reach. Furthermore, the user is able to attack and trap their targets with their considerably strong jaws. The user also has an incredible amount of durability in their transformed state.<br><br>The fruit's multiple heads also allow the user to survive decapitation, even in Human Form, resulting in the user being required to be beheaded eight times in order to die.<br><br>Weakness:<br>Although the user is capable of surviving decapitation number of times equivalent to the number of heads they have, they cannot regenerate any of the heads they have already lost, thus reducing their lifeline each time they suffer a death. Attacks that can decapitate multiple heads at once, in particular, further reduces this survival ability's efficiency."

The greatest strength of this fruit is the ability to suck someone else's life force either by biting the victim's neck or digging their nails into the victim's skin. By sucking the victim's life force, the user can age them to regain their own youth, with Red implying the fruit grants immortality and eternal youth as long as there is life force for the user to drain. The user can also return the life force to to their victims if they choose to do so, and there were no ill effects to the victims after their life force was returned.<br><br>Weakness:<br>It is unknown if the fruit gives the user the usual weaknesses of a vampire such as sunlight, garlic or crosses, but the user does require taking another person's life force to use the fruit's power to its full potential. Otherwise, it has standard Devil Fruit weaknesses. "

They were formerly manufactured by Donquixote Doflamingo and Caesar Clown and were monopolized and consumed by the members of the Beasts Pirates, which created the classifications of the Gifters, Pleasures, and Waiters within the crew.<br><br>Production:<br>The key ingredient required to concoct the artificial fruits is SAD, which is a chemical substance created by mixing the extracted Lineage Factors of numerous animals together. Only Caesar Clown possesses knowledge of how to create SAD, and as such, the production of these fake Devil Fruits requires Caesar's cooperation.<br><br>Attribute:<br>A SMILE fruit is intended to grant the consumer the power of animal transformation, much like a Zoan type Devil Fruit, by a process which involves transmission of the Lineage Factor of a real animal. Like normal Devil Fruits, SMILEs render those who consume them unable to swim. SMILEs do appear to grant enhanced physical abilities, much like real Zoan fruits. These fruits give the user the respective animals abilities such as super sonic hearing(bat smile) sticky spit(Alpaca smile) flight(bird smile),ETC.<br>Even with the increased strength and animal abilities bestowed by the SMILEs, many, if not all of these artificial Devil Fruits appear to be greatly inferior in strength compared to actual Zoan fruits.<br><br>Side Affect:<br>SMILEs, being artificial, do have side effects. Due to the faulty chemicals used to make them, only one out of every ten SMILE fruits will successfully grant Zoan like abilities at the cost of being able to swim. The other 90% of people who consume one will not receive a power while suffering the usual consequences. On top of losing the ability to swim, they permanently become unable to express negative emotions, being forced to smile and laugh all of the time regardless of how they actually feel, even while getting hurt in battle or if someone they care about dies."
