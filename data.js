Like some of the other Logia type Devil Fruits, it allows its user to fly, by turning his body or the lower part of it into smoke, greatly enhancing his movement and speed. <br><br> The main offensive capabilities of the fruit stem from its user's ability to change the density of the smoke produced at will. This allows Smoker to surround his targets with his intangible smoke and then solidify it to grasp them. This power has granted Smoker his epithet The White Hunter. The smoke can also be used as a blunt weapon, hitting enemies with great strength.Another common tactic of Smoker’s is to transform his limbs into smoke, but not his hands, enabling him to strike opponents with his Seastone-tipped jitte from a much greater range, or to launch himself jitte-first at his opponents like a rocket by transforming his lower body into smoke. <br><br>Weakness:<br> It would seem that when confronted by fire, they will cancel out one another due to being the same temperature; other than that, no specific natural weakness has yet to be seen"

This ability is usually life-threatening to any living organism, causing plants, animals or people to suffer from dehydration. Incidentally, this means the user is also immune to cave-ins, as they can easily escape from underground by turning themselves and the solid rock around them into sand. Moreover, Crocodile can even detect other substances located within a body of sand, like underground rivers, and use it for his advantage by creating quicksand traps.<br><br>Weakness:<br> The Suna Suna no Mi is one of few Logia-type fruits that can naturally counteract their own weakness.

The flames can also be used to increase the force of physical attacks.

        info:"This fruit allows the user to control darkness and its unique property of gravity(black hole).<br><br>Usage:<br> The darkness is visually demonstrated by a black smoke-like substance spreading out from the user's body. The darkness is a void that devours and crushes everything. Due to this, the user can absorb physical matter and attacks of any type by sucking it into the darkness. The user can also use this ability to irresistibly pull the opponent to them, regardless of their current state.<br> Similar to a black hole, the user can absorb things inside a vortex. It seems that it does not completely compress and annihilate that which is sucked in as an actual black hole would do, but rather creates some form of space where things are stored. Blackbeard was able to suck an entire town into himself, and when he eventually regurgitated, everything that was expelled was reduced to scraps but not completely destroyed. Living beings who are absorbed seem to be able to survive being absorbed and expelled, but become heavily wounded and left in shock by the experience.<br><br> In addition to the previous abilities, this fruit somehow has one unique and frightening ability that separates it from all other Devil Fruits: the ability to absorb and completely nullify the powers of other Devil Fruit users by simply touching them. All types, be it Paramecia, Zoan, or Logia, are affected by this, though Logias are the most affected as they can no longer become intangible by transforming into their respective element.<br><br>Weakness:<br>The major strength of this particular fruit, the darkness that the user turns into which swallows up everything, is also its major weakness. Since the darkness also absorbs attacks, the user of the fruit is still vulnerable in battle, which does not pass through the darkness they turn into. If they fail to absorb an attack in time, the user can be hurt like any other normal human being or even more, as stated by Teach. Unlike other Logia fruits, the Yami Yami no Mi does not seem to give Blackbeard access to an elemental state where he can disperse, reform, or regenerate his body."

The Hie Hie no Mi's power is considered a superior counterpart to the Yuki Yuki no Mi's, ice being a superior freezing agent to snow.<br> While other Logia fruits give their users the ability to dissipate out of harm's way by turning into their respective elements, it is interesting to note that this fruit is one of the few Logia fruits that can be hit with a physical attack. This is mainly because ice is a solid-state element, and thus, the user cannot simply dissolve out of harm's way as most Logia-users can with their fluid bodies, and it is slower in terms of reforming the body when damaged. However, most attacks are still ineffective against this fruit because its user can simply shatter and reform the ice composing them on impact. It is also apparent that the user can control the ice in his body to mold it and change its shape, as seen when Kuzan formed a hole in his chest before Whitebeard stabbed through Kuzan with his bisento.<br><br> The user can instantly freeze anything that comes in contact with them, whether the user grabs onto the foe or the foe makes contact with the user's body. If the frozen area is not treated properly and immediately, then the resultant frostbitten areas will suffer permanent tissue damage. It has not been shown, both Blackbeard and Garp have asked Kuzan to unfreeze their subordinates after he attacked them, implying that the user can manually undo the effects of the Devil Fruit.<br><br>Weakness:<br>Other than that, the user is also vulnerable to the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses. However, with the power over ice, this grants the user one of the few known powers capable of counteracting the standard Devil Fruit weakness."

The user, like any Logia, is able to transform into light to let incoming attacks pass right through them. The user is also able to travel at the speed of light, form hard light constructs, create or split into shining particles for locomotion, regeneration or even multiplication, and reflect themself between surfaces to any desired location.<br><br>Notably, the user's body becomes so lightweight that they become capable of standing over something as small and fast-moving as a cannonball in mid-launch, or float in mid-air for a few instants.

In addition, any application of light, whether in technology or weapon, is useless against the user's body, as they can simply bypass anything that is comprised of a laser or light system.<br><br>Weakness:<br>Since this fruit is light-based, some of the user's attacks, like lasers, can only travel in straight lines.

Weapons, such as swords, were also shown to melt after coming into contact with Akainu. The Magu Magu no Mi has one of the highest offensive power among the Devil Fruits. Along with the incredible corrosion and temperatures, the magma-based attacks also carry highly explosive properties; one attack is enough to cause an explosion capable of inflicting tremendous damage throughout the entire battlefield. Just by forming an attack, the heat coming off his body has been shown to melt enemy weapons around him. Sakazuki has been shown to repeatedly pierce through the bodies of his adversaries with ease using his power.

However, he can also become dense enough to hold objects, like his cocktail glass. The gas that Caesar produces is very poisonous. The gas appears to be explosive when set alight, which allows Caesar to create controlled explosions without harming himself. Additionally, the user has the power to manipulate other preexisting gases in any given location, and can suffocate their opponents by removing the oxygen in the area. This gives the user two options to instantly defeat their opponent, allowing Caesar to knock out Luffy after realizing that Luffy was immune to poison (however the area effect is finite, so if someone escapes the oxygen-free zone they will be able to breathe again). They can even merge with such gases to enhance his own power, depending on the gas being absorbed, all the while being immune to the toxic effects himself.<br><br>Weakness:<br>The gas form appears to be weak against fire, although this is mitigated by the user's ability to minimize oxygen levels in the surrounding area, preventing combustion. On the other hand, it seems to take some concentration or is only possible while solid to manipulate the oxygen, as Usopp and Nami could breathe again when Brownbeard struck Caesar with a metal pipe, and there seems to be a range of which Caesar can control oxygen, leaving him more vulnerable to longer-ranged attacks.

She could also manipulate the density of the snow to form solid snow barriers. These barriers are extremely hard, making it difficult to destroy them, but she could easily pass through her snow barriers. She also had the ability to weaken someone and make them lose consciousness by hugging them, using her cold body to sap their own body heat. By transforming into snow she could secretly hide in snowstorms, as seen when she followed Trafalgar Law through the Ice Lands without being noticed. She could also release a massive snowstorm to take advantage of the cold to weaken her opponents in a similar way. She also used her powers to change the battlefield into a snowfield so she could dive into the snow from her snowstorm to hide, move, trap and attack her enemies quicker.<br><br>Weakness:<br> She also has a weakness to heat, as shown when Nami used her Clima Tact's Heat Egg to damage her wing.

The plants spawned by this ability can be grown rapidly and made to move around freely, seemingly being not limited by the rigidity and stiffness that some plants, like trees, normally possess.

As for offense, the great (flying) speed, strength, and size conferred by the transformation allows the user to violently push back and cause notable damage to whatever they fly into headfirst, be it a person or massive structure (large ship). The user's pteranodon beak is long, sturdy, and an effective pointed weapon, allowing King to affix himself to smaller targets and then divebomb into structures in order to tear them apart.<br><br>Moreover, the user is given the supposedly natural ability of using their pteranodon head like a slingshot of sorts: pulling their beak back into their face by pulling on their head crest, then releasing their grip to shoot out their head like a bullet, piercing whatever they aim at with incredible force. According to King, this conforms with how pteranodons used to hunt their prey in ancient times. Aside from their head and beak, the user's wings can make potent weapons as well given their sturdiness, able to generate cutting winds or clash against swords as if they were blades themselves.

Beside strength, the user, in their less heavy hybrid form, becomes much faster, especially due to their strengthened dinosaur legs. Ulti is able to dart through the air at extreme speed by jumping, while proportionally increasing the impact force of her attacks in the process, and can casually dodge extremely fast-moving attacks, disappearing from sight.<br><br>With the transformation, the user's skull grows thicker and harder, which suits Ulti particularly given her fighting style that revolves around headbutts.
