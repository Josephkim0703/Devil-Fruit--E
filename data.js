This allows Smoker to surround his targets with his intangible smoke and then solidify it to grasp them. This power has granted Smoker his epithet The White Hunter. The smoke can also be used as a blunt weapon, hitting enemies with great strength.Another common tactic of Smoker’s is to transform his limbs into smoke, but not his hands, enabling him to strike opponents with his Seastone-tipped jitte from a much greater range, or to launch himself jitte-first at his opponents like a rocket by transforming his lower body into smoke. <br><br>Weakness:<br> It would seem that when confronted by fire, they will cancel out one another due to being the same temperature; other than that, no specific natural weakness has yet to be seen"

This ability is usually life-threatening to any living organism, causing plants, animals or people to suffer from dehydration. Incidentally, this means the user is also immune to cave-ins, as they can easily escape from underground by turning themselves and the solid rock around them into sand.

The user can also use this ability to irresistibly pull the opponent to them, regardless of their current state.<br> Similar to a black hole, the user can absorb things inside a vortex. It seems that it does not completely compress and annihilate that which is sucked in as an actual black hole would do, but rather creates some form of space where things are stored. Blackbeard was able to suck an entire town into himself, and when he eventually regurgitated, everything that was expelled was reduced to scraps but not completely destroyed.

The Hie Hie no Mi's power is considered a superior counterpart to the Yuki Yuki no Mi's, ice being a superior freezing agent to snow.<br> While other Logia fruits give their users the ability to dissipate out of harm's way by turning into their respective elements, it is interesting to note that this fruit is one of the few Logia fruits that can be hit with a physical attack. This is mainly because ice is a solid-state element, and thus, the user cannot simply dissolve out of harm's way as most Logia-users can with their fluid bodies, and it is slower in terms of reforming the body when damaged. However, most attacks are still ineffective against this fruit because its user can simply shatter and reform the ice composing them on impact. It is also apparent that the user can control the ice in his body to mold it and change its shape, as seen when Kuzan formed a hole in his chest before Whitebeard stabbed through Kuzan with his bisento.<br><br> The user can instantly freeze anything that comes in contact with them, whether the user grabs onto the foe or the foe makes contact with the user's body.

The thin sheets of paper can be used to inflict cutting damage on enemies and launched as projectiles. Transforming into paper also enables the user to fly freely. In addition, by using strange symbols written on the pages of an ancient book, the user is able to produce various elemental and physiological effects.<br><br>Simon used his ability to fly by transforming into paper, which allowed him to travel between islands without a ship. In combat, he launched sheets of paper as projectiles and used the strange symbols on the pages to inflict various effects on his opponents. He also used his ability to heal his injuries and avoid attacks.<br><br>Weakness:<br> Although paper would normally be weak against fire, the user can counter this weakness by using a symbol with the power to suppress fire. This was demonstrated when Simon was able to counter the flames of Usopp's Kaen Boshi. However, if the pages are splashed with paint, the symbols lose their power and fire becomes a substantial risk. Aside from this, it is also subject to the the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses."

        info:"This Devil Fruit allows the user to transform into a kind of green-colored candy syrup.<br><br>Usage:<br> The user cannot be hit nor sliced because his body will just absorb the impact or take the blade which also immobilizes the attacker which then allows the user to pummel his enemy. The user can use it to either make himself syrup-like (with sticky properties to trap the opponent) or intensely solid. Despite being syrup, it seems to be inedible, as seen when Luffy tried to contain Gasparde in his mouth, only to be forced to spit him back out.<br><br>Gasparde has mostly been seen using this fruit for combat purposes. The stickiness of the syrup allows him to trap his opponents in his body when they attack him, which then gives him the free opportunity to pummel them with his great strength. Gasparde can turn into liquid syrup to let attacks bypass him, evading harm. However, he has not fully mastered his ability, thus a surprise attack can cause him pain.<br><br> Gasparde's primary method of attack is akin to how the Toge Toge no Mi is used: transforming parts of his body into spikes of hardened syrup to impale his opponents, or covering his entire body full of spikes and launching himself forward to heavily skewer them, which also was meant to serve as a deterrent from counterattacks. Gasparde also used the syrupy properties to mimic Luffy's rubber elasticity powers, stretching his arms forward to extend his syrup spear, and to create a slingshot effect for his own body.<br><br>Weakness:<br> Like a few other Logia Devil Fruits, this one has a weakness that can nullify its intangibility: flour. When flour comes in contact with the user, he loses his stickiness and he is vulnerable to physical attacks."
